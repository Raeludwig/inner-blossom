# inner-blossom
A mental health single-page React application which provides well-rounded resources for users to assess and address their mental concerns, with options to display and hide features such as yoga, journaling, and a daily unique quote. It essentially provides a safe place for relaxation just like drinking a cup of inner blossom jasmine tea.
